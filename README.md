# End-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline on Azure ML Studio: Project Summary

This project demonstrated the end-to-end process of building, evaluating, and deploying a binary classification model on the Azure Machine Learning Studio platform. The Adult Census Income dataset was utilized, with the goal of predicting whether an individual's income exceeded $50K/year based on various demographic and employment-related attributes.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Experiment Setup:**
   - A new experiment was initiated within Azure ML Studio.
   - The Adult Census dataset was imported, containing features like age, education, occupation, and the target variable: income level.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Imputation:** Missing values were handled by replacing them with '0' (a simple imputation strategy). For more robust strategies, refer to [Imputation Techniques](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html).
   - **Feature Selection:** Irrelevant or redundant features were removed using the Select Columns in Dataset module.
   - **Metadata Modification:** Specific columns were converted from String to Categorical Feature types using the Edit Metadata module.

3. **Class Imbalance Mitigation:**
   - **Upsampling:**  The minority class (income > $50K) was upsampled in the training data only to address the significant class imbalance. For more details on upsampling, see [SMOTE](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html).
   - **Comparative Modeling:** Two models were trained – one on the upsampled data and one on the original – to assess the impact of upsampling.

4. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - **Algorithm Selection:** A Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree model was chosen for its suitability for binary classification tasks. Learn more about Boosted Decision Trees [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting).
   - **Hyperparameter Optimization:** The Tune Model Hyperparameters module was used to systematically explore different hyperparameter combinations to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Scoring and Evaluation:**
   - **Performance Assessment:** The Score Model module generated predictions on a held-out test set, and the Evaluate Model module facilitated the comparison of model performance.
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** The Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve served as primary evaluation metrics, providing insights into the model's discriminative power and overall predictive capability. You can learn more about these metrics [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic).

6. **Deployment:**
   - **Web Service Creation:** The trained model was published as a web service, enabling real-time inference through the Azure ML platform.

## Key Considerations

- **Imputation:** The chosen imputation method was basic; other techniques might be more appropriate for different datasets.
- **Feature Engineering:** More advanced feature engineering could potentially improve model performance.
- **Algorithm Selection:** While the Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree performed well, exploring other algorithms could lead to further optimizations.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Thorough hyperparameter tuning is crucial for maximizing model performance.


This project provides a solid foundation for building and deploying machine learning models on Azure ML Studio, offering a practical example of how to leverage the platform's capabilities for real-world applications.
